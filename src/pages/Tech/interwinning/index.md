It's interview season big time. Companies doing the rounds, all online, trying to pick the best, as are freshers, aiming to gain a stronghold. 

It's but a routine tale to hear that so-and-so guy who barely knew enough talked his way to bag the offer, and another guy, who knew enough stuff, but couldn't speak well enough, lost out. I know the pain only too well.

I've had experience interviewing for a number of companies, and bagging offers from some of them. Doesn't mean I am an expert. Nope, far from it. I've done far more things wrong, than I've done right. And probably that has given me some invaluable experience that I hope to share.

1. English : Leaving patriotic sentiment aside, English is the de facto unifying factor out there. English is the only way how an interviewer from Assam can communicate and hire a candidate from Gujarat. And that means, that not only do you have to know normal English well enough, you have to know  FORMAL english. Modern day slang like 'So, like', 'Basically', 'You know', sets you far back in scores, as these are seen as fillers and deterrents from the actual route you wanna go to. Learn English well enough to speak slow, concise, formal, stressing correctly, pausing correctly, avoiding pauses. It's especially troublesome for students from vernacular backgrounds to get up to speed here, but working on it since Day 1 of college, and you'll be good as gold by the time you have your first interview.

In 89% cases, projects are usually asked about, only in the HR round, where the company has almost made a decision about hiring you, and is just looking to cement the reasons. Goofing up at this point sucks bigtime. A lot of people goof up. And the funny part? Not all of them know they have goofed up.

Nerd developers and people who want to look like nerd developers have gobbled up half of MDN and vomit out the jargon in their interview,

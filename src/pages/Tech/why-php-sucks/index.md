You just can't be a developer and not have read at least one post on why PHP is the software developers' version of Lord Voldemort. Enormous influence, yet wicked at the core.

PHP has more memes on it than it has code, and not good memes. It's been called vicious names like the 'evil developer's curse', 'Software world's Donald Tru-(Shhh)'.

And the funny part? Most of these names are made by people who have never ever even used the language, but are going along for the heck of it. Let's try and explore what PHP is, why it's hated, and if any of the hate is well-founded.

PHP is a server side scripting language, aka, a language to write back-end code. It talks to databases, and its favorite DB is MySQL.

There have been a number of software-astrologers predicting that PHP is going to end, and they've been doing that ever since 2010, since Node came out. Tell you what, it's 2020, and PHP still has more websites than Node or Django, COMBINED. These people are like Donald Trump saying that the Coronavirus was going to go away magically by May.

Few people know this, but PHP WASN'T MEANT TO BE AS WIDESPREAD AS IT IS TODAY. It was meant to be for limited private use. It's as if you use your old tshirt to make a rag to clean your desk, and that rag sets out to become its own fashion brand.

PHP is hated, because it doesn't have a strong design, it is very inconsistent, and not at all scalable or secure. Well, IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE SO!!!

Another point that noobs MISTAKE in saying, is that PHP is COMPLEX. 

NO IT'S NOT!!!! 

PHP sucks because it's easy. It's SO easy, that it skips over some design constraints that make it complex.

So, never ever say it isn't easy. It blotted its own reputation, just so it could be easy.

I'm a strong believer in one idea, quoting myself

> Success isn't by the good decisions you make, but by the best you can make out of your bad decisions.

I'd like to be really really forceful today; I'm not fucking around. 

Everyone has their share of good and bad decisions. I always used to pride myself on having the ability to take MAJORLY good decisions. And that implied, that the bad decisions I took, were disastrous.

December 2019. I had one semester before my internship started. This semester was THE MOST crucial semester of my life. I had to push up my grades, or I would end up missing out on a lot of opportunities. I had to be well prepared enough for the internship, because I wanted it to convert to a job offer. I had to keep up with my Data Structures and Algorithms skills, which would be my sole savior, in the event that I couldn't convert my internship into a full time offer.

I had already taken a bad decision the last semester: Signed up for a role that'd make me have to dedicate almost ALL my time to the role, a role that was so fraught with politics, back biting, a role with immense pressure, my reputation at stake.

In this already troubled situation, I made another mistake : Taking up a project under a mentor without researching the background of the role, the mentor or the requirements. This was a project with academic credits, mind you, at a time when I was already under pressure to keep my credits good. And that's not all. I gambled. The same mentor, who was offering the project, was also offering a course in the semester, and me, in all my folly, thought that maybe, if I worked well enough in one of them, maybe I could strike gold by getting a good score in both. 

So, I gambled 35% of credits of the most crucial semester of my life based on this hope of mine.

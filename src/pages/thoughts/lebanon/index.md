August 4, 2020 - It seemed like 2020 could be no worse, when 2750 tonnes of Ammonium Nitrate burst, near the port in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, and burst with such tremendous intensity that the shocks could be felt more than 240km away. That's equivalent to a blast happening in Delhi and the effects being felt in Chandigarh.

With it, came the question of how on Earth, did Ammonium Nitrate, which was KNOWN to be explosive, stored so hazardously, for YEARS, without the government doing nothing about it? And that's when it started coming to light, that the blast was not just of a one-time government negligence, but indicative of a state that was slowly edging into total collapse.

The government of Lebanon hasn't been able to agree to a budget for 11 years.

Almost 3 US presidential terms are completed, and this government couldn't decide on what to do with the money?
And since there was no money around, the Central bank of the country started a nice little scheme

This is the kinda scheme we're talking.

It's called a Ponzi scheme in financial terms, wherein you take money from investors, promising them returns, onboard a newer set of investors, from whose investments you pay the earlier set of investors, and this cycle goes on.

To imagine, the Central Bank of a country indulging in such schemes would defy belief, right? And yet, they had to, because the government didn't know who to give the money to. 

Why did this happen? Almost the entire country is controlled by a handful of top notch rich people, who skin the economy and the commoners alive, leveraging political propaganda to further their own monetary aims. Lebanon is torn between the Sunni-Shia war that has plagued the Middle East since decades. Iran backed Hezbollah, an organization marked as terrorist by the US, has ties with the existing president, and in fact, has a major role in import of arms, ammunition and explosives into the country. This is opposed to Sunni muslims backed by Saudi Arabia, which has been using Beirut as a puppet in its war against Iran.

The Lebanon pound has lost about 80% of its value against the US dollar, and relies almost entirely on imports, of which 80% came to the Beirut port, the port which is now ravaged, pulling the economy into crises.

1 in every 3 people in Lebanon are unemployed, and this number is expected to go up to 3 in 4 by Dec 2020.

A government already bankrupt, with one of the most corrupt bureaucracies in the world, and which is being survived solely by international aid.

The reason I write this story is to speak about governments. There wouldn't be a single person on Earth who'd be perfectly satisfied with the actions of their respective governments. And that's true. Democracies, ideally, are supposed to represent the voice of the public. And that can only come about in the truest sense when we voice our opinions and expectations. This, however, does NOT mean that we enter into illogical criticism of the government, just so that we have SOMETHING to criticise the government with.

As an example, I recently came across a social media brawl of a very well known investor, who was raking in millions, inspite of the lockdown, however, losing no opportunity to criticize the government, that 'MADE HIM STAY INDOORS FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES'. 

That's just a whole new kind of strange : What government on Earth would benefit if the guy stayed indoors? In fact, the government has lost billions in the lockdown. It still does it, because health is a crises here. As one of the most densely packed countries in the world, we are at a risk quite unprecedented, due to COVID.

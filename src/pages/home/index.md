Do note, that all three substacks are different, and you'd have to sign up to different ones differently, based on your interests.

I talk about three things : 

1. Tech : I love explaining how things work, in a sarcasm-dosed, funny way, with crazy examples so that you get a feel of the topic. I talk about Full Stack Web Development, Android, Natural Language Processing.

2. Markets : I analyze markets and business strategy in depth, and bring to you, some of the hottest stories in the market, from complete case studies of WeWork, Uber to analyses of stocks, and corporate concepts.

3. Data Strutures and Algorithms : DSA is without a doubt, an extremely crucial skill for technical interviews, and being a Software Engineer myself, I have given my share of DSA interviews. Have failed in many, succeeded in some, learnt a lot through all of them. Here, too, I explain standard problems, by outlining the entire thinking process behind the problem, starting from a brute force solution, to optimize it step by step, with time and space complexities explained.

Yemen was in the news recently over US designation of a Yemeni group called Houthis as terrorists. But this news failed to cast enough light to what is vastly believed to be the worst humanitarian crisis the world has ever faced. The situation is a devastating example of how a people torn between larger countries politically motivated against the other, can be used as expendables.

Yemen is a country in the Middle East, south of Saudi Arabia, borderning Oman. It boasts of no special powers or extraordinary wealth or strategic importance and is one of the poorest in the region, but has found itself in the center of conflict backed by two powers out for each others' heads - Saudi Arabia and Iran. 

The prologue - while the country was economically stagnant for quite a while under the rule of dictator President Ali A Saleh, things took a dramatic turn during the Arab spring of 2011, when a number of countries in the Middle East and Africa took to the streets to overthrow autocratic governments. Yemen saw a similar one, and that led to resigning of Saleh. In an attempt mediated by the UN and the Gulf Cooperation Council(GCC), Vice President Hadi took control as the new President, but there was a problem - not everyone wanted him. 

An extremist, separatist group called the Houthis, which had been at war with the Yemeni government, first under Saleh, and now under Hadi, advanced and took control of Sana'a, the capital, with support from military forces loyal to Saleh, the ousted president, forcing Hadi to flea to Saudi Arabia. The Houthis declared a new government immediately.

The Houthis were Shia'ite muslims, against Hadi, who was Sunni. While not being an overly dominant factor, the sectarian differences had been cause of clashes all throughout the Middle East, and this was no different. To make matters worse, when Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council decided to back Hadi against the Houthis, Iran, Saudi Arabia's sworn enemy saw it upon themselves to uphold the Shia'ite control and began indirectly supporting the Houthis. 

What was an intra-country governance conflict, within no time, escalated into a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and its coalition forces against the Houthis, backed by Iran. This aggressive bombing campaign failed to heed to repeated attempts by the United Nations to negotiate a peace deal between Hadi and the Houthis. The UN attempted at striking a peace deal between the Houthis and the Hadi government, and in fact, Saleh even offered to mediate the peace process, but the Houthis felt it was detrimental to their interests and broke away and killed Saleh.

Thus began one of the darkest chapters in the history of the world - as two powers, consummated by their desire of political domination, mercilessly bombed civilian areas, cutting off much needed humanitarian aid and refusing to back down.

The war, coupled with a deep economic crisis the country was already engulfed in, exacerbated by a cholera epidemic in 2017, the worst outbreak in recorded history, and recently, the COVID pandemic have made the situation what it is, the worst humanitarian crisis in history. While exact data is close to impossible to collate, estimates show that more than 80% of the country's population is in dire need of humanitarian aid, aid that's growing increasingly sparse as the rival powers blockade ports and airports. More than 50% of the population is on the brink of starvation. 

If you read carefully, you'll notice that there's simply no mention of what the people of Yemen want, after the uprising of 2011 - and that's indeed the case. This war is not by the people who actually live there, or who're affected directly by the government. It rather has become a warzone for countries who don't want to fight wars at their own borders. 

You might wonder - the US has the vastly criticized habit of poking its nose everywhere - why not here? Well, that's not entirely true. The principal player in the conflict, Saudi Arabia, is a strong US ally, and President Donald Trump has given Saudi Arabia unbelievable freedom to bend humanitarian laws - in fact, most of the bombs used by Saudi Arabia in Yemen are US manufactured. And US supporting one of the main perpetrators of the problem means that they're not politically motivated to try and reach a consensus. Moreover, in its quest of the global war against terrorism, the US has also launched bombing campaigns in regions where Al Qaeda and ISIL factions hold sway.

I hope the reason for Houthis being designated terrorists by the US - a move that all but destroyed any hopes of consensus between the rivals, is now clear as night and day.

### Is there any hope?

Luckily, there is. Donald Trump's presidency ends on Jan 20, and with that, his close camaraderie with Saudi Arabia. The incoming President Joe Biden is expected to have a tougher stance against Saudi Arabia and its war crimes, reach a deal with Iran and diffuse tensions in the region, and thus, cool matters in Yemen too.

But the negotiations will take years to take effect, and in the meantime, war is expected to continue to wage in the tiny country.

### How does it matter for you and I?

We are humans. We see humans being massacred. At best, we can do well enough to sympathize with the plight of the Yemeni people and be grateful for what we have.

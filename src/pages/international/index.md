The United States war on Afghanistan

Many of us tend to believe that the US first took more than a fleeting interest in Afghanistan only after the infamous 9/11 World Trade Center attacks. That is, however, not the case. The US, following its ideologue as a proponent for democracy, took notice as, in the early 70s, the existing Shah of Aghanisthan was overthrown, and Afghanistan took on its spell of multiple governmental structures, flipping between democratic parties, warlord run sects, to Islamic extremist central rulers, as more people joined rebellions.

While the US did take interest in the developments, it was cautious to take a more aggressive role - it was already going through a lot in itself. President Kennedy had been shockingly assassinated in '63, relations with Cuba were at their worst, threatening a third World war, the Vietnam war, the Watergate scandal leading to the first and only Presidential resignation from office, the Cold war with Russia at historic highs, and more. However, in 1979, the USSR military swooped in to support the regime against the uprisings, and the US and its allies, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, swooped in to protect the rebels, the latter two, with the fear that the uprisings of the Pashtun community might provoke Pashtuns in their own countries to get some ideas.

It was during these uprisings, that several men were disillusioned and radicalized, with the result, that the Taliban was founded, the extremist organization preaching strict adherence to Sharia law, and around the same time, another organization, by an Arab, Osama Bin Laden - the Al Qaeda.

Al Qaeda was suspected to be behind the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and that meant that the US lost its temper. President Clinton ordered CIA special forces to go into Afghanistan to capture and exterminate bin Laden and other AQ leadership, but they were shielded by the Taliban, and thus escaped.

Then came, 9/11 - a sunny day in the US. 4 US airplanes were hijacked soon after take off - two of them rammed into the World Trade Center towers in New York City, and one, the Pentagon, the organization at the helm of US defence. The 4th one was meant to crash into the Capitol, which houses the offices for the US representatives and senators, or the White House, but due to the heroic acts of passengers onboard, they managed to subvert it, and the plane crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Around 3000 people died in these vile attacks, and the US was in a state of shock.

As soon as it became clear that AQ jihadists from the Hamburg Cell of AQ were the hijackers, the Bush government demanded Taliban to cough up the leaders. It is noteworthy, that 15 of the 20 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia, a US ally. When the Taliban demanded proof that it was AQ and bin Laden behind the attacks, the US lost its temper.

On October 7, 2001, President George W Bush along with the support of the UK, launched Operation Enduring Freedom, to free Afghanistan of the extremist, terrorist-harboring government by aiding the anti-Taliban, Afghan National Front. Owing to the combined military might, were successful in wrestling power from the Taliban in within a month.

Following this, the ISAF appoined an interim govt headed by Hamid Karzai to oversee the transition and nation rebuilding process. Karzai was soon sworn in as the President. Bin laden was cornered into a mountainous area, but managed to escape to Pakistan, and then to the Middle East.

Things soon got out of hand, however. The new government was riddled with corruption, and this was exacerbated when the US declared war on Iraq in 2003, owing to the threat of dictator Saddam Hussein, and for which, the US and its allies redirected a majority of their military resources to Iraq, from Afghanistan. The US forces in Afghanistan transferred control to an unshaky, inept Afghan government, and Taliban seized the moment to retake control of several parts of rural Afghanistan.

One special target of the Taliban and its allies was the Ring Road, which was being built by US companies and Afghan workers, and expected to give the govt more reach to the rural, mountainous regions. By disrupting construction of this road, the Taliban limited govt reach over the rural areas, allowing them to take over several parts of the hinterland.

Troop nos. kept fluctuating until 2011, when, under orders of President Obama, US Special Forces stormed a lone bungalow in Abbotabad, Pakistan and shot and killed the man responsible, Osama Bin Laden, following which, the US slowly started recalling troops back from Afghanistan, and therefore, allowing the Taliban to again retake control over a good part of the country.

What's the situation today : 

A peace deal was signed between the US and the Taliban on Feb 29,2020 that laid out guidelines for a phase wise US withdrawal from the country, and in return, the Taliban agreeing to not allow areas under its control to train terrorists and enter into negotiations with the Afghan govt. And while this is good on paper, in absence of an official cease-fire, civilian attacks continue to exist, and Afghanistan remains a war torn zone.

Relation to India : 

India, on paper, shares a border with Afghanistan, but since the border is in the territory enroached by Pakistan, that claim is dubious. What is not, however, is the fact that terrorism in India is a grave threat. A recent study placed India at position 8 in the world, in terms of effect of terrorism. Pakistan has been known to fund Taliban and other allied terror groups, many of which have made attempts on India.

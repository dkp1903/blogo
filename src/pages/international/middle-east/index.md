This is a brief primer to understanding the delicate power balance situation in the Middle East, and will serve as a prologue to understand several future 'International' probes of wars that have ravaged the region.

The Middle East includes countries of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Lebanon, Oman, Yemen, Israel, Jordan and also share political and demographic similarities to Egypt, Sudan, Turkey, Morocco and Libya.

The situation in this region is extremely fragile, depending on a countless number of religious, political, demographic and economical stands.

One major reason of strife is the fight between Islamic sects Sunni, led by Saudi Arabia, and Shia, led by Iran. Several experts say that this wasn't a very major reason of political strife, until recently, but some of the more sectarian politics of leaders like Iraq's Saddam Hussein and his successors, those propagated by extremist groups, soon made this an immensely strong divide.

While internal disagreements are frequent, the power blocs can be divided into:

A. The Gulf Cooperation Council - led by Saudi Arabia, includes UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and might soon expand to include Jordan and Morocco. Saudi Arabia, being home to the Muslim holy sites of Mecca and Medina, calls itself the ruler of the Islamic world.

B. Iran - while it looks like just one country, it holds considerable sway in war torn Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, thanks to militant groups allied to them. The country was initially ruled by a pro-west Shah, who was overthrown by an Islamist movement in 1979, that brought an anti-west Islamic cleric named Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei to the helm of the government. This threatened Saudi Arabia's position as the ruler of the Islamic world, as Iran touted itself as the leader and criticized Saudi Arabia for siding with the US and the western world. 

This was the beginning of an unending cold-hot war, as the two countries supported different groups in various countries in the region, like Iraq, Syria, Yemen to fight for influence.

Israel is stuck in a rather unique situation, and while the whole ztory of Israel deserves another probe of its own, as a big picture, most Arab states, until recently, had not recognized Israel as a sovereign country because of its refusal to grant statehood to Palestinian Arabs. This situation has begun to shift ever so slightly because the Trump administration has taken a very pro-Israel, anti-Palestine stand and convinced Bahrain, UAE, Sudan to normalize relations.

Another striking feature in the region is the concept of chiefdoms and regional militias, which often rise against governments and ally themselves with either foreign powers, or with or against terror groups. Some examples are the Kurds in Iraq and Syria, which were anti-ISIS, Houthis in Yemen, which are against the internationally recognized government, among others. 

The situation worsened as world powers like the US weighed in. Donald Trump strongly supported Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, and waged a standoff with Iran by withdrawing from the nuclear deal called JCPOA which was established by the Obama administration along with allies to put a check on Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for relaxation of sanctions. This led to worsening of the situation in the Middle East as Saudi Arabia waged inhumane wars to counter Iranian influence, and there was no check on Iran's nuclear interests and it wasted no time in kickstarting them again.

Syria and Iraq are some of the worst hit countries in the region, thanks to the establishment of the ISIS(Islamic State in Iraq and Syria), an Islamic extremist terrorist group that, in the aftermath of the Arab spring, had captured large swathes of territory in the countries and declared a caliphate. The ISIS was soon driven out by multiple countries' militaries and local militant groups with international support, but left the countries ravaged. 

The situation is especially dire in Syria, where dictator President Bashar al Assad used chemical weapons on his citizens in a bid to quell uprising. Russia and Iran supported Assad, and Saudi Arabia and the coalition supported the anti-Assad rebel groups.

Iraq has had a history of turmoil, especially after US toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, but thereafter failed to stabilize the government, breaking the country into regional chiefdoms and proving fertile breeding ground for ISIS. While ISIS has mostly been ousted, the Iraqi government remains shaky, with Iran pushing for influence and anti-Sunni sentiments and Saudi Arabia trying to counter Iran.

And it's not just the Saudi Arabia - Iran standoff or the government - terrorist organization fights that are the only existing skirmishes. The region has also seen soured relations, including a blockade on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and allies over Qatar's support of the Muslim brotherhood and the Al Jazeera news network that critically covered some of the royal families of these countries. 

Also, yet another long standing dispute is the recognition of Israel as a country, which most Arab powers, until recently had refused to do, because Israel was accused of stifling voices of the Palestinian Arab population, and while the situation has remained the same, if not worsened, the Trump administration has opted for a strongly pro-Israeli stand, and convinced at least Bahrain, Morocco and UAE to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel. 

The region possesses most of the oil and gas used around the world, and thus, a war in this region would mean a stalled world economy too.

In future probes, we'll be looking at most of these countries individually and see how conflicts have unfolded in them, and given rise to terrible tragedy.

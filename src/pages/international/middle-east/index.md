This is a brief primer to understanding the delicate power balance situation in the Middle East, and will serve as a primer to understanding several of my future 'International' probes of wars that have ravaged the region.

The Middle East includes countries of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Lebanon, Oman, Yemen, and also share political and demographic similarities to Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Libya.

And these countries live in a very religiously and politically volatile situation. On one side, is a group called the Gulf Cooperation Council, with Saudi Arabia being the de-facto ruler of the group, and including UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar and potentially, Jordan and Morocco. 

Facing them off is Iran, and its strong political influence in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon, all of which are torn by wars, civil or otherwise. Also present in the region are terrorist groups, the most prominent of them being Al Qaeda and the nearly destroyed but still existent ISIL(Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant), most of which are engaged in political control with the countries.

Yet another striking feature in the region is the concept of chiefdoms and regional militias, which often rise against governments and ally themselves with either foreign powers, or with or against terror groups. Some examples are the Kurds in Iraq and Syria, which were anti-ISIS, Houthis in Yemen, which are against the internationally recognized government, among others. 

The most friction, however, is because of the religious-sectarian differences between two of the strongest powers - Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia, home to Islamic holy sights of Mecca and Medina, had long called itself the undisputed ruler of the Islamic world. Saudi Arabia is a Sunni majority country. 

This power of Saudi Arabia was challenged in 1979, when an Islamic revolution broke out in Iran, which led to the removal of the Shah(monarchial ruler) of Iran who was allied to the US, and establishment of a Shia Islamist cleric-ruled state, under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomenei. 

This threatened Saudi Arabia's position as the ruler of the Islamic world, as Iran touted itself as the leader and criticized Saudi Arabia for siding with the US and the western world. 

This was the beginning of an unending cold-hot war, as the two countries supported different groups in various countries in the region, like Iraq, Syria, Yemen, to fight for influence.

The situation worsened as world powers like the US weighed in. Donald Trump strongly supported Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, and waged a standoff with Iran by withdrawing from the nuclear deal called JCPOA which was established by the Obama administration along with allies to put a check on Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for relaxation of sanctions. This led to worsening of the situation in the Middle East.

Syria and Iraq are some of the worst hit countries in the region, thanks to the establishment of the ISIS(Islamic State in Iraq and Syria), an Islamic extremist terrorist group that captured large swathes of territory in the countries and declared a caliphate. The ISIS was soon driven out by multiple countries' militaries, but left the countries ravaged. 

The situation is especially dire in Syria, where dictator President Bashar al Assad used chemical weapons on his citizens in a bid to quell uprising. Russia and Iran supported Assad, and Saudi Arabia and the coalition supported the anti-Assad rebel groups.

Iraq has had a history of turmoil, especially after US toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, but thereafter failed to stabilize the government, breaking the country into regional chiefdoms and proving fertile breeding ground for ISIS. While ISIS has mostly been ousted, the Iraqi government remains shaky, with Iran pushing for influence and anti-Sunni sentiments and Saudi Arabia trying to counter Iran.

The region possesses most of the oil and gas used around the world, and thus, a war in this region would mean a stalled world economy too.

In future probes, we'll be looking at most of these countries individually and see how conflicts have unfolded in them, and given rise to terrible tragedy.

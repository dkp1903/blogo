Let's start this series with an event that radically altered the world order - the start of the United States' war on terrorism, one that has shaped US foreign policy ever since, and the reason why the US finds itself in the jam every time some regional dictator tries to stand up - the 2001 war on Afghanistan.

It is the longest war ever fought in US history, one that failed to achieve its ultimate motive, but at the same time causing thousands of deaths. So, what happened?

While most of us, me included, used to believe that US interest in Afghanistan started only after the infamous 9-11 attacks when hijacked planes crashed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the story is much older.

Afghanistan was under monarchy rule until the mid 70s, when the ruler was ousted in a coup, and a Soviet backed communist government took power. Given the shaky nature of the government, the USSR invaded Aghanistan in '79 to support the government against Islamic rebel groups supported by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Remember, this was a time when the Cold war was at highs, and to counter USSR influence, the US too, began supporting the rebels with arms and resources - remember this point, because it's going to come back and bite them later.

Rather than being one concerted effort, the rebels were a patchwork of different groups and tribes, and the three countries backed different sets based on their interests, and that was the nature of the country - it was a patchwork of different tribes, rather than a commonly defined identity. However, a collective of this opposition was called the Mujahideen. 

The Mujahideen were successful in overthrowing the communist government and came to power - now came the bitter infighting among the various tribes about who would control the government. One extremist Islamist group was successful in quelling competition and rising to fame - the Taliban, a group that promoted strict interpretation of Sharia law, including banning female education, severe punishment for minor crimes and most importantly, a strong anti-West sentiment.

By 1994, Taliban overpowered the other rebel groups and came to control in Kabul. It had a symbiotic relationship with one extremist, anti-American guy from Saudi Arabia, a man called Osama Bin Laden, leader of the group Al Qaeda. He was expelled from his own country because he believed that the rulers were sold out to America, and later from Sudan. He masterminded operations across the Middle East and Africa, targeting American bases and strongholds. He also helped the Taliban to power, and in return, the Taliban promised him immunity. 

In 1998, Bin Laden was responsible for the bombing of US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. Then US President Clinton ordered a CIA special forces insertion into Afghanistan to try and capture Bin Laden, but with the support of the Taliban, Laden evaded capture. Enraged, Bin Laden traded a deal with the Taliban, wherein Al Qaeda fighters assassinated the leader of the Northern Alliance, the main opposition to Taliban, in exchange for safe harbour against the US for something unthinkable that was about to come.

The moment that'd change history - that fateful day of September 11, 2001, the day New York city was holding elections for Mayor, four planes were hijacked from US airports, by 19 jihadists(jihadists - those fighting enemies of Islam) most of them of Saudi nationality. Two of the planes crashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York city. Yet another plane crashed into the Pentagon in Washington DC, the seat of the US Department of Defense. And yet another plane, bound for the Capitol or the White House, was overtaken by passengers' valiant actions, and crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 

The events shocked the world, as much as they did the US - who, on realizing the hand of bin Laden in the attacks, gave Taliban an ultimatum to hand him, and other Al Qaeda leadership over, which the Taliban denied for want of proof of involvement. And thus, on October 7, 2001, President George W Bush ordered Operation Enduring Freedom, which was much more than the war against Al Qaeda-Taliban in Afghanistan - it was the beginning of US's war on terrorism. 

The US and its strongest ally, the UK, sent troops to Afghanistan, soon followed by NATO countries sending their own troops, where they partnered with anti-Taliban local group, the Northern Alliance, and succeeded in ousting the Taliban from power in just two months. However, they failed in their main motive - the capture or death of Osama Bin Laden, who was nearly caught in the battle of Tora Bora, but escaped to Pakistan, a Taliban ally. 

The United Nations approved an interim government, headed by leader of a rebel group, Hamid Karzai, who'd soon be elected as the President of Afghanistan. With this, the US and allied forces set on a mission to rebuild the country and consolidate power for the newly elected government. However, things didn't go as well as they hoped.

The US invaded Iraq in 2003, to depose of dictator Saddam Hussein who was accused of possessing chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction(WMDs), and the US shifted resources, money and military to Iraq. This allowed the beaten but still existent Taliban to relaunch an insurgency by winning back the rural areas. The situation kept aggravating as the alliance forces kept being outgunned by the Taliban, and thus allowing the Taliban to keep winning back territory.

In 2011, an operation ordered by President Barack Obama was successful in killing Osama Bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. With this, the US planned for a steady transfer of power to the Afghan forces, and withdrawal of troops from the region.

While Presidents Obama, Trump and now, Biden have expressed strong wish to end the war, the situation keeps worsening - the US expects the Taliban to commit to assuring no harm to Americans on American or foreign soil, and in return, the US troops would leave the country. However, the two sides have continually failed to reach agreements.

All the while, Afghanistan has gone from a disturbed country to being a failed state with a namesake government at the helm, large swathes of territory occupied by extremist militants, the Taliban and the US in a failing attempt to stabilize the situation - the idea of health, education and a normal life are almost a distant yearning for the Afghani people.

## Why is this event so important strategically

The US invasion of Afghanistan marked the start of the US war on terrorism, and has seen a marked changed in US foreign policy, as subsequent US military advances in Iraq, Libya, Syria gained more momentum. This is also a case study of how a power struggle between militaries can ravage a country - today Adghanistan is torn, with most means of livelihood nearly gone, virtually non existent essential services and little semblance of government. 

Inability of the US and its allies to see through the war, as well as rampant corruption of the government has aided the Taliban in retaking swathes of territory.

## Why is it important for India

India's history has seen a series of unfortunate terrorist attacks brought out by extremist Islamist groups which are accused of having links with Al Qaeda, which Taliban harbours. India's fight against Pakistan funded terrorism has found a much stronger voice after this, and the final result in Afghanistan could very well determine the state of insurgency in Kashmir and other parts of the country.

Trump isn't a person - he's a movement

20th January, 2021 saw the end of one of the most controversial, divisive presidencies in the history of the United States, and as many in the US and around the world rejoiced the last day Donald Trump was in the White House, there was a lingering question in the minds of many - 

Trump might have gone, but has Trumpism gone?

The fact behind this seeming rhetoric can be understood by looking at Trump's rise to power. He had no political experience whatsoever, but managed to beat seasoned politicians, first those of his own party, then Hillary Clinton to clinch the presidency. His style, even looking at it the most optimistically, was extremist. He made racist, xenophoblic slurs, kicked diplomacy out of the window and gave way to inhumane personal insults against those who opposed him, and pushed for an isolationist stand - and he won. And that he did, by appealing to an emotion that was out of sight, but very clearly existent.

Most people expected, or hoped, that he would give up this extremist rhetoric once he was in office, but if anything, it just exacerbated. 

Joe Biden remarked in his inaugural speech, "The differences we have run long and deep", and he's right - extremist orientation, both right-wing and left-wing has been sown in the country, and the world since quite some time. But they were squashed by American presidents and other world leaders, who pushed for unity. Not Trump, though. He magnified the voices of far-right groups, propagated these on media and point blank refused to denounce the groups for fear of losing their support.

This support by a head of state made these groups grow more confident of their stand and power, and they pushed, culminating in a Ku Klux Klan(American white supremacist, far right extremist group) rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the spread of the QAnon conspiracy theory and most dangerously, the attack on the US capitol, incited by Trump. In spite of his hate-mongering, his massive failures to control the pandemic, improve the economy, or improve foreign relations, more than 74 million Americans voted for Trump. The level of his appeal shows when the outcome of the election was decided by 43000 votes that went to Biden, the combined margins in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin, which, had they gone to Trump, would have given him 4 more years.

And while Trump lost, his movement didn't, as was seen by the overwhelming support he had in his false claims of the election being stolen. 


While Trump might have left the White House, possibly for good,

I'm a crazy productivity geek - crazy, believe me. I quite literally surf for hours on Producthunt, sifting through new tools that I can try.
And while that may seem like a lil overboard, why I do it will be more relatable - No regrets.

That's it

I want to live a life where I can do stuff without regretting that I did it later. And I am looking for ways I could do that.

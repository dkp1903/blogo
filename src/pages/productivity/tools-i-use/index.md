**Disclaimer : This is an opinion post. I get no reimbursement in cash or kind in any way from any of the tools/companies mentioned in the post. I write of my experience, with no attempt to disrespect the creators of the applications.** 

Productivity is a dream for all, aim for most, and actionable for some. I went through all three phases - I was awed by how scheduled could life actually be, how I wanted that, and finally, what I would need to do to get there. But like all other things in life, too many cooks spoil the broth. Stark contrast from the olden days when you used sticky notes and a device known as a pen to note down important stuff, the pandemic has made even this basic, seemingly undying aspect digital. And being what I am, a Software Engineer, I felt it my duty to follow the trend and go digital with that.

 

And it was this idea of being digitally productive, scheduled and well managed that found me rummaging through Play store and Producthunt looking for good productivity tools.

This might sound cliche, but productivity is a very subjective term, and that means the tools out there intended to make us more productive are based on SOMEONE'S definition and understanding of productivity, and might not work the way we want them to. If your definition coincides with theirs, well and good, otherwise, you're gonna have to squeeze.

Another point - a large majority of tools are focused on team productivity - making sure teams are able to work together with as less of meetings and repetition and overcommunication and miscommunication as possible. The team tools, while they're perfectly usable for individual users, bring in a lot of team specific features, like chat, quick meeting scheduling, user activity, that are not only not needed for individual users, but also confuse and disrupt, contradicting the very aim with which we had begun to use the tools in the first place. 

I started my quest through simple trial and error. Over the course of a couple of months, I tried more than 15 different apps and tools. In all, repeat, ALL of em, I found something lacking, because remember the above point - productivity tools are built on how the builder conceives productivity. If you want a fully customized solution, go make your own ðŸ˜¡

(And while I did try to list out all that I needed to make my own productivity tool from scratch, it was not just confusing to figure out all I wanted and hard to make it all, but also pointless to be building everything from scratch, when you could just use the tools available for use if you found the right one.)

Just like every other beginner, I started with a lot of enthusiasm, going on to one of the most sophisticated apps out there - Clickup. For the uninitiated, it's this gigantic monolith of an application that is touted to store every aspect of your life - tasks, projects, goals, schedules, have a zillion integrations with other apps like Gmail, Google Calendar, and a host of other features like doc spaces that had me crushed under a barrage of ~~awe~~ confusion. I struggled to find my way about the application for the first couple of hours, finally got some hang of it, and erected a basic enough structure of my projects, tasks and notes into the app. I tried using it a couple of days, but finally gave it up. Here's my feedback on the same - 

Pros - 

- Can hold everything, provided you have time to set it all up.
- Allows notifications, email and mobile. This was a very important point for me - remember I said, I needed someone to push me?
- UI is pretty good looking

Cons -

- WAYYYYYYYYYY TOOOOOOO complex. The good guys at Clickup didn't want to do a half ass job, so they did it all. And when I say all, I mean it. And while it might be good and usable for a lot of folks, my premise was simple - I needed an app that would make me more productive, save me some time. Clickup was making me spend more time on managing the damn thing itself.
- THe UI has excellent color choices and look, but often buggy and behaves slightly unexpectedly, and thus, UX falls short.
- Clickup has this distinction between tasks, reminders, agenda that I could never get the hang of - and that meant that if I wanted to view all that I had to do, I always ended up missing out something because all of these wouldn't turn up in the same place.

Thus, I realized Clickup wasn't for me. I next switched to Monday.com, quite similar to Clickup in most aspects, and didn't really find a solution yet again(Go figure). I next tried Asana, which was good for task management, but a lot of its features went into the premium banner, and that too, fell short of expectations.

Trello has been one of the earliest entrants to the productivity game, and has earned a sturdy, easy-to-work reputation. I had used it to some success in an earlier venture of mine, and thus, was hopefully it might provide me with a solution. Here's what I found - 

Pros

- Lightning fast UI - You click, and it's done. No lag. Clickup had quite a bit of lag
- Very simple to understand, intuitive UI. You know what goes where
- Really good if task management/project management is your only goal

Cons

- Task management/project management wasn't my only goal, unfortunately. I also wanted a scheduler, a note taker and a few other features which Trello didn't provide.
- The Mobile app isn't very good. Mobile work was one primary requirement that I had, and Trello didn't quite help me here.
- Notification system is a lil messed up. I don't know if it was just some blunder I made, but I'd either get a barrage of notifications, important, unimportant everything, or get just none at all. Not something I could quite wrap my head around
- Trello limits the number of powerups in the free version to three  only  - I needed more. Powerups are add-ons, like Calendar, Butler, Drive integration etc

Thus, Trello didn't work out for me either. I also tried normal todo list apps like Todoist, Any.Do, Google Tasks, but they didnt really fit all my requirements.

At this point, as you can well expect, I was pretty close to giving up. I had almost made up my mind that productivity tools weren't for me, and I'd better stick to pen and paper and writing things on whatsapp as todos. 

Then, one day, I ran into a news article about a technical outage at Notion. Notion, hmm. I had used it before to hold some stuff for me, but it was pretty early in the development phase, and didn't have a lot of integrations and features I had needed. But one thing struck me - unlike all of the tools I mentioned above, Notion touted itself as being a personal productivity tool. In fact, sharing is allowed for only upto 5 people in the free version, so they mean it. The best part? It was extremely customizable. Essentially, all you got was empty pages. You could do whatever the heck you wanted with them - create task lists, timeline views, calendar views, just write quick notes, add embeds, anything. 

Having to set it all up was one reason why I hadn't considered Notion earlier, but now, after trying all the apps that gave you a structure and seeing how that turned out, this customizability appealed a lot more to me.

So, once again determined, I started out. I had enough of a bittersweet experience trying to add everything to an app, only to ditch it one day later, so I took it slow. I first created only a couple of pages, one to hold a list of tasks for my internship, the other as a quick note to record stuff discussed in meetings. And I tried working it a couple of days. 

Pros - 

- This is probably the best part, and a primary reason why I have stuck with Notion - it actually doesn't take time to mark up stuff there. As I said, it's unopinionated and very customizable, so, I could just use it for what it's meant to be used for - productivity, and I soon found I was better able to keep track of stuff off my mind.

There are quite a few pros, but I wasn't about to learn them until later, so will mention them later.

Cons - 

- Mobile support is meh-ish. While Notion has a well maintained mobile app, given its customizability, mobile experience isn't the best one. I don't blame them. I could never use Google docs to my satisfaction on the phone. Notion has a similar UI and use case.
- Reminders - while reminders are supposed to work on Notion, sending push notifications via the mobile app, as well as Desktop and email notifications, the latter didn't work for me - probably some error I did activating them. And no reminders means no push - that was one of my earliest requirements - someone had to push me to do something.

That's when I stumbled, quite literally, upon the answer - this voice that would start blabbing when I mistakenly pressed the home button for too long - Google Assistant. Like almost everyone else, I had done a lot of BS with Google Assistant - asking it if he had a girlfriend, if he was a he, if he knew who his boss was - that kinda 'locker room talk'. Now, I decided to actually use it for what it was meant to be used for.

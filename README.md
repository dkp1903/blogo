This is DKP, a Full Stack JavaScript developer, and Nerd-In-Chief at DKProbes. Here, I write about three things : 
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Markets
- Tech

and I can usually do so in a way that's sarcastic enough for you to remember it. I have two bimonthly newsletters, for the posts that I make, so be sure to check out the links on the homepage for those.

Tech Stack used for the blog : Gatsby(A react framework for making static websites - includes React, GraphQL and a ton of other stuff), Netlify

Blog architecture inspired from my God [Dan Abromov's blog](https://overreacted.io)
